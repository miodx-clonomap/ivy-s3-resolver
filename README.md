##### Ivy resolver that supports publishing to S3 objects.

This little Java library powers the [sbt-s3-resolver](https://github.com/ohnosequences/sbt-s3-resolver) plugin which allows publishing and resolving artifacts to/from Amazon S3.

To add a dependency in your sbt project use this:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ohnosequences" % "ivy-s3-resolver" % "<version>"
```

See also [API documentation](http://ohnosequences.com/ivy-s3-resolver/docs/api/latest/).
